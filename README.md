# musiccollaborativefiltering
This repo features the code used in the "Build a Spotify-like Music 
Recommender System" that suggests music artists using collaborative filtering 
and Alternating Least Squares. In the process, get a foundation about music recommenders,
how Spotify recommends music, and how to use a production-ready collaborative filtering 
Python library called ‘implicit’.

To run the code, you need to install the package and its dependencies using 
poetry:

```bash
poetry install
```
